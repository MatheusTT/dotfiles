These are my personal configurations for Linux, tailored to enhance productivity and streamline workflows.
They are designed to be lightweight, modular, and easy to manage.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice: Void Linux Configuration (Deprecated)

This `void` branch contains dotfiles tailored for Void Linux. Please note that this branch is no longer actively maintained, as I have transitioned away from using Void Linux. Consequently, updates to this branch will be infrequent or nonexistent.

For the most up-to-date configurations and active maintenance, please refer to the [`master`](https://github.com/MatheusTT/dotfiles/tree/master) branch.

## ‚ö° Features
- **Window Managers**: Configurations for Hyprland and BSPWM.
- **Development Tools**: Pre-configured for Python, Rust, Flutter, and more).
- **Automation**: Managed with [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) for consistent setup across systems.

## ‚öô Installation
Make sure you have `chezmoi` installed. You can install it by following the [official guide](https://www.chezmoi.io/install/).

Run the following command to initialize my dotfiles with chezmoi:
  ```bash
  chezmoi init --apply MatheusTT
  ```

If you want to install everything (including rust, zen, and wallpapers) do this:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MatheusTT/dotfiles/void/install.sh | sh
